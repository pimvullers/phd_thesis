\subsection{Self-blindable Credentials}

The third chapter, titled Self-blindable Credentials, is based on two papers,
\emph{Developing Efficient Blinded Attribute Certificates on Smart Cards via
Pairings}~\cite{BatinaHJMV10} which is joint work with Lejla Batina, Jaap-Henk
Hoepman, Bart Jacobs and Wojciech Mostowski, and \emph{Privacy and Security
Issues in e-Ticketing -- Optimisation of Smart Card-based
Attribute-proving}~\cite{HoepmanJV10} which is joint work with Jaap-Henk
Hoepman and Bart Jacobs.

\subsection{U-Prove}

The fourth chapter, titled U-Prove, is based on the paper \emph{Efficient
U-Prove Implementation for Anonymous Credentials on Smart
Cards}~\cite{MostowskiVullers11} which is joint work with Wojciech Mostowski.

\subsection{Identity Mixer}

The fifth chapter, titled Identity Mixer, is based on the paper \emph{Efficient
Selective Disclosure on Smart Cards using Idemix}~\cite{VullersAlpar2013} which
is joint work with Gergely Alp\'ar.
