\section{Functional Comparison}

Self-blindable:
 this technique currently only supports binary
attributes; for example, instead of a descriptive string of nationality, the
answer to the question ``Is French?'' is stored.

The drawback is that, due to the untraceable nature of this technology,
incorporating revocation is hard and very costly~\cite{HoepmanLV11}. % TODO: search for alternative reference.
Furthermore, ECC support on smart cards is very limited making prototyping
very hard. Finally, the technology is fairly new compared to U-Prove and
Idemix, and not backed by a big company which offers support for it.
