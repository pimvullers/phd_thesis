Five years have passed since I started my PhD program in Nijmegen. On the one
hand this is a journey that one has to perform alone, on the other hand it is a
journey one cannot finish alone. Therefore I would like to say thank you to 
everybody who helped me during this period. I don't want to deprive anybody, 
but there are some that I want to thank explicitly.

First, my supervisor, Bart, who supervised my PhD thesis, but also my daily
activities. You have supported me in my research and the writing of my articles,
but you have also promoted my results and supported me in gaining experience in 
teaching. Despite your busy schedule, there has always been time to discuss my 
daily worries. Bart, thanks.

I did not write the articles, on which this PhD thesis is based, alone. Hence,
I would like to thank my co-authors, Wojciech, Gergely, Bart, Jaap-Henk and 
Lejla sincerely for their help. I also want to thank Wojciech and Erik for 
teaching me their knowledge and experience in programming smart cards, which 
has been useful throughout my research.

Furthermore I would like to thank my fellow PhD students for the good time I 
have had. At the research school IPA it has always been fun, in particular with
Jeroen and Carst, my fellow students from my student days in Eindhoven, and 
Gergely and Wouter, my colleagues from Nijmegen, and of course the organisers 
of IPA, Tim and Meivan. At the university I shared a spacious office with many
other PhD students. The joint work, but definitely also the breaks and
conversations made it a nice place to work. I remember, in particular, the 
small security research projects together with Joeri and Gerhard.

During my PhD program I have had the opportunity to do an internship at 
Microsoft. This allowed me to gain experience and get an impression of a 
research department of a large company. Christian, thanks for making all the 
necessary arrangements and the supervision during my stay at Microsoft.

My research laid the foundations for the IRMA project which focuses on the use 
of attribute-based credentials in practice. This project took up a lot of time 
and I am glad that I did not have to do this work alone. Antonio, Bart, Gergely,
Jaap-Henk, Maarten, Martijn, Roland, Ronny and Wouter, thanks.

I would also like to thank the members of my thesis committee for the time they
have spent judging my PhD thesis. In particular I want to thank Sjouke, since he
has also been the supervisor of my MSc project in Luxembourg.

All the effort spent in these years has obviously also affected my personal 
life. During the defence of my doctoral thesis my brothers Bas and Koen will 
take the role of paranymphs. Koen also saved me a lot of time by designing the 
cover of this thesis. My parents, Jan and Gerrie, have always supported me 
throughout my academic career, even when they could not understand what I was 
working on.

Finally I want to say thank you to Marlou, for whom it was not always easy
during these years (in particular during the writing of this thesis), but who
always supported me to finish this work. Thanks.
